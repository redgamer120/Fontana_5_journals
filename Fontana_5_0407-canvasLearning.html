<p>I have learned that functions can be very modified. For example the drawing for the tree(s) you could change the density of the branch ending so they looked more realistic. This code was also very confusing.
<p>I have also learned how to change the css through javascrip. For example you could change the style of something such as a stroke. Or even better reload a webpage.
<p>The last most important thing that I learned was buttons. When ever you click on them what ever you want them to do all you have to do is to program them. Really neat and useful.
