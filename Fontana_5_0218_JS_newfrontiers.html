This code is almost the same as a css file's hover atribute.
The if statement see's if the value of the object that you are hovering over and sets it's value to true.
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
Ex
function myFunction(p1, p2) {
    return p1 * p2;              // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
}
</body>
